What does the following XML fragment do.


<bean id="myTestBean" class="com.stw.core.person.Person" scope="prototype" factory-method="createNew" depends-on="dataSource">
	<property name="firstName" value="${first.name}"/>
	<property name="phone" ref="phone"/>
</bean>


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This XML fragment comes from a "spring.xml" file. This is a configuration file to define the various objects that will be managed 
by Spring framework. Those objects are manage by the “Spring IoC container" and are named Beans. 

This code creates the Bean "myTestBean" defined by the class "com.stw.core.person.Person".

This Bean is not considered as a singleton (scope = "prototype"), which means that when two requests are made for that Bean, a new 
instance of this object is provided by the BeanFactory.

This Bean use the factory method "createNew" to be instantiate (factory-method="createNew").

The bean "dataSource" is a dependency of "myTestBean" (depends-on="dataSource"), wich means that "dataSource” is used to set 
properties of "myTestBean". The “depends-on” attribute is used to explicitly force "dataSource" bean to be initialized before “myTestBean” is initialized.

The property “firstName“ is using the “datasource” Bean.

This Bean is using a reference to “phone”  Bean.
